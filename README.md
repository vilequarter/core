*Development has slowed down significantly due to a recent move halfway across the world. I'm currently trying
to focus on the Open University Fullstack course, but I hope to pick this back up again soon. There's probably
going to be a lot of refactoring and cleanup in order to follow the best practices I've been learning.

This is an over-ambitious incremental game where you play as a Dungeon Core trying to gather Essence and improve your capabilities.
I'm using this project to build experience in web development, heavily focused on React, but I'd like this to turn into a full game I can be proud of.

Current functionality:
* Consume Resources for Essence!
  * Eat lots of Dirt!
  * Crunch some Pebbles! (not currently balanced)
* Expand Influence!
* Speed up time with Contemplation!
  * Contemplation is gained while the game is not in focus or offline
* Research!
* Constructs!
  * Essence storage & auto-dirt-consumption!
* Saving!
  * Currently 10-minute auto-save
  * Settings tab includes a manual save button, text-formatted export/import buttons, and a hard reset button
* Informational Messages!
* Bugs, probably!
* About 1-2 hours of content!
  * Endgame: Research "Essence Spiral"

Upcoming functionality (roughly in order of priority):
* More Research!
* More Constructs!
* Lore/Story!
* Changelog!
* "Win" Condition!
* Less-ugly layout!
* Themes!
* Additional Elements!
* Less Bugs!

Theme inspired by the "Divine Dungeon" book series by Dakota Krout.
Mechanics inspired by a host of other incremental games.
