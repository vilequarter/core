This is an over-ambitious incremental game inspired by the book series Divine Dungeon by Dakota Krout.
I'm using this project to build experience in web development, heavily focused on React,
but I'd like this to turn into a full game I can be proud of.

Current functionality:
* Eat Dirt!
* Gain Essence!
* Expand Influence!
* Speed up time with Contemplation!
⋅⋅* Contemplation gained while game not in focus
* Ability to do only one thing at a time!
⋅⋅* This is intentional and will change with research

Upcoming functionality (roughly in order of implemenation):
* Saving!
⋅⋅* Including import/export and hard reset
* Offline gain of Contemplation!
* Research!
* Messages!
* Constructs!
* Less-ugly layout!
* Themes!
