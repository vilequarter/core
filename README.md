This is an over-ambitious incremental game where you play as a Dungeon Core trying to gather Essence and improve your capabilities.
I'm using this project to build experience in web development, heavily focused on React, but I'd like this to turn into a full game I can be proud of.

Theme inspired by the "Divine Dungeon" book series by Dakota Krout.
Mechanics inspired by a host of other incremental games.

Current functionality:
* Eat Dirt!
* Gain Essence!
* Expand Influence!
* Speed up time with Contemplation!
  * Contemplation gained while game not in focus or offline
  * Offline progress is not currently implemented, and is a low priority in favor of Contemplation
* Ability to do only one thing at a time!
  * This is intentional and will change with research
* Research!
