This is an over-ambitious incremental game inspired by the book series Divine Dungeon by Dakota Krout.
I'm using this project to build experience in web development, heavily focused on React,
but I'd like this to turn into a full game I can be proud of.

Current functionality:
* Eat Dirt!
* Gain Essence!
* Expand Influence!
* Speed up time with Contemplation!
  * Contemplation gained while game not in focus or offline
  * Offline progress is not currently implemented, and is a low priority in favor of Contemplation
* Ability to do only one thing at a time!
  * This is intentional and will change with research
* Saving!
  * Currently 10-minute auto-save and a manual save button in the Settings tab
* Informational Messages!

Upcoming functionality (roughly in order of implementation):
* Research!
* Constructs!
* Changelog!
* Less-ugly layout!
* Themes!
